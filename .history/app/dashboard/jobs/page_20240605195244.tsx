        In the summer of 2023, I joined the Orbital Programme at the National
        University of Singapore. <br />
        We were tasked with implementing a personal project from scratch. <br />
        Hence, my partner and I created a travel-planning web application that
        earned the highest level of achievement, `Artemis`.
