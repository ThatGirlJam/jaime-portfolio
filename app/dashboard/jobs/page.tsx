        From May to August 2024, I worked as an Intern at A*STAR Institute of

        In May: Learnt about data collection, pre-processing and literature
        surveys on LLM applications. Set up the evaluation of Generative AI
        results on their accuracy at Text-to-SQL tasks, specifically in relation
        to patient information. Data from the MIMICSQL dataset was translated to
        appropriate DAIL-SQL format, and was used to test execution accuracy for
        open source LLMs such as codellama and deepseek-coder. DAIL-SQL is an
        integrated solution that refreshes the Spider leaderboard with 86.6%
        accuracy.
