        From January to December 2025, I worked as a Software Engineer intern an SF Bay based startup

        In particular I learnt the following:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Learnt about Frontend Web App development (React, Custom Components), 
        Backend Web App Development (NestJs, Jest, Prisma, PostgreSQL) 
        and CI/CD practices (GitHub Actions). I also learnt about the Software Development Cycle, 
        fast prototyping and product development.

      <p>
        From May to August 2024, I worked as an Intern at A*STAR Institute of
        High Performance Computing. I was trained on an LLM-related skillset,
        where in particular I learnt the following:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Learnt about data collection, pre-processing and literature
        surveys on LLM applications. Set up the evaluation of Generative AI
        results on their accuracy at Text-to-SQL tasks, specifically in relation
        to patient information. Data from the MIMICSQL dataset was translated to
        appropriate DAIL-SQL format, and was used to test execution accuracy for
        open source LLMs such as codellama and deepseek-coder. DAIL-SQL is an
        integrated solution that refreshes the Spider leaderboard with 86.6%
        accuracy.
